## [11.0.0] - 2021-03-26

Merge MC generators in `atlasmisc.sty` with those in PMG document.
Add PMG document to the templates directory.
Remove macros with version number, as this is now an optional argument for the default macro names.

### Added

- Add PMG MC snippets and document.
- Add a  macro `\Hll` to `atlasprocess.sty` and `atlashepprocess.sty`
- Updated ATLAS Errata.
- `shownote` option for `atlasdoc.cls`. Normally the note number is turned off for the final version of PUB notes, as it should be added by CDS.

### Changed

- Fixed a couple of references in `ATLAS-useful.bib`.
- Use `https` for DOI.
- Small updates to `atlaslatex_update.sh`.

### Removed

- MC macros with version number, as this is now an optional argument:
    `\ACERMCV, \ALPGENV, \HerwigV, \HERWIGV, \JIMMYV, \MADGRAPHV, \MGMCatNLOV, \MCatNLOV, \AMCatNLOV, \MCFMV, \METOPV, \OPENLOOPSV, \POWHEGV, \POWHEGBOXV, \PYTHIAV, \SHERPAV`

### Fixed

- Wrong command was documented for listing ToDo notes - should be `\listoftodos`.

---

## [10.0.0] - 2020-11-23

The October 2020 LaTeX update led to options being ignored when passed to a document class or a style file if the filename contained a directory.
While this bug will probably be fixed at some point,
it in general appears to be better to adjust the macro `\input@path`
to specify the directory that should be searched for the ATLAS LaTeX packages.
Hence a new style file `atlaslatexpath.sty` has been introduced and should be loaded using

```latex
\RequirePackage{latex/atlaslatexpath}
```

before the `\documentclass`.

### Added

- New style file `atlaslatexpath.sty` to set search path for style files and document class.
- New script `atlaslatex_2020.sh` to make adjustments to main files for TeX Live 2020.

### Changed

- Changed version numbering from 09-03-00 to 10.0.0 (follows Semantic Versioning).
- Templates and documentation switched to use of `atlaslatexpath.sty`.
- `atlaslatex_update.sh` script can self update and checks for use of `\ATLASLATEXPATH` macro.

### Deprecated

- The macro `\ATLASLATEXPATH` should no longer be necessary or be used.

### Removed

- Use of the `\ATLASLATEXPATH` macro in templates and documentation.
- Removed `texmf` targets in `Makefile`, as regular targets work in the same way.

### Fixed

- Block option was being ignored in `atlasbiblatex.sty` as of version 07-01-00.
- Remove a duplicate reference from ATAS-SUSY.bib.

---

This section describes the MC samples used for the modelling of \tH\ production.
Section~\ref{subsubsec:tHq_aMCP8} describes the \MGNLOPY[8] samples,

\paragraph{Short description:}

The production of \tHq events was modelled using the \MGNLO[2.3.3]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}
generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF).
The events were interfaced with \PYTHIA[8.230]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea} using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the
\NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}. 

\paragraph{Long description:}

The \tHq samples were simulated using the \MGNLO[2.3.3]~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}
generator at NLO with the \NNPDF[3.0nlo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function~(PDF). The events were interfaced with
\PYTHIA[8.230]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}~ using the A14 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} and the \NNPDF[2.3lo]~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} PDF set. 
The top quark was decayed at LO using \MADSPIN~\cite{Frixione:2007zp,Artoisenet:2012st} to preserve spin correlations,
whereas the Higgs boson was decayed by \PYTHIA in the parton shower.
Both the four-flavour and five-flavour schemes were considered.
The functional form of the renormalisation and factorisation scales was set to the 
default scale $0.5\times \sum_i \sqrt{m^2_i+p^2_{\text{T},i}}$, where the sum runs over 
all the particles generated from the matrix element calculation.
The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were simulated using the \EVTGEN program~\cite{Lange:2001uf}.

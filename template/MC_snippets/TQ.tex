\section{Top-quark processes}
%\label{sec:TQ}

This section describes the samples used for top-quark processes.
The \ttbar\ samples are described in Section~\ref{subsec:ttbar}.
Single-top samples are described in Section~\ref{subsec:tW} for $tW$ associated production,
in Section~\ref{subsec:tchan} for $t$-channel production,
and in Section~\ref{subsec:schan} for $s$-channel production.
Finally, \ttHF\ samples are described in Section~\ref{subsec:ttHF}.
